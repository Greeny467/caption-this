Scrolling through social media we all have heard the phrase best caption win and then no one actually wins. Well what if you did win. With Caption This you can win, it all starts with one person posting a picture or video and then the clock starts ticking. It then becomes a timed battle for the best caption, whoevers caption is at the top of the leaderboard when the clock hits zero is the winner. What do you win you may ask, you win the right to have your caption atached to the post anytime you scroll past that post your caption is always attached.
